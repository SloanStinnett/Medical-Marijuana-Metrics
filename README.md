# Medical-Marijuana-Metrics
The purpose of this paper was to examine how demographic characteristics of Oklahoman municipalities affect the number and concentration of licenced medical marijuana dispensaries in the municipality. To investigate this question we examined previous literature to create a host of demographic variables that we believe may be of significance to the size and concentration of the market and performed multi-linear regression to measure their effects on both. We found that in Oklahoma the main driver of the number of medical marijuana dispensaries was total population with all other demographic variables lacking significance. Poverty rates and private insurance rates were found to both have a significant and negative effect on the concentration of medical marijuana dispensaries in Oklahoman municipalities. Comparing these findings to the previous literature leads us to believe that either the dynamics between demographic variables and the size and concentration of dispensaries is sensitive to the geographic scale under study or that there is spatial non-stationarity in the relationships found for Oklahoma differ significantly from those expected when looking at studies performed on other parts of the country such as California and Colorado.
